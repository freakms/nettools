<analysis>**original_problem_statement:**
The user's initial goal was to port an existing Python  network utility application to a modern, optimized technology stack for Windows. After an initial discussion about C#/.NET, the user, guided by the agent, chose to proceed with a **Rust backend and a Tauri frontend using React**. The user provided a design system guideline with the specific instructions to exclude the lünefire branding and logo, and to set the copyright to frekms. The objective is to replicate and enhance the functionality of the original Python application in this new stack.

**User's preferred language**: German. The user communicates exclusively in German. The next agent **MUST** continue the conversation in German.

**what currently exists?**
A new Tauri v2 project has been created from scratch at . The project uses a modern frontend stack including React, TypeScript, Vite, and TailwindCSS. The basic application shell is fully built, including a sidebar, header, command palette, and base UI components that adhere to the user's provided design guidelines.

Backend Rust commands and the corresponding frontend pages have been implemented for an initial set of seven tools:
- IPv4 Scanner
- Port Scanner
- DNS Lookup
- Traceroute
- Subnet Calculator
- Hash Generator
- Password Generator

The project has undergone extensive and collaborative debugging to resolve numerous issues on the user's local Windows machine, including dependency installation (Rust, VS Build Tools, CMake), PowerShell policies, and version conflicts (Tauri v1 vs v2). The user is now able to successfully compile and run the application in development mode.

**Last working item**:
-   **Last item agent was working:** The agent created the React-based UI pages for the seven tools listed above and connected them to the corresponding Rust backend functions using Tauri's  API. This was done in direct response to the user pointing out that the tool pages were just placeholders.
-   **Status:** USER VERIFICATION PENDING
-   **Agent Testing Done:** Y (Agent confirmed the frontend builds and runs; backend functionality can only be tested by the user on their machine).
-   **Which testing method agent to use?** Manual testing by the user. The agent has provided instructions on what to test for each of the new tool pages.
-   **User Testing Done:** N

**All Pending/In progress Issue list**:
-   **Issue 1: User Verification for Newly Implemented Tools (P0)**
    -   **Description:** The user needs to test the seven newly functional tools (IPv4 Scanner, Port Scanner, DNS, Traceroute, etc.) on their local machine to confirm they work as expected. This is the most critical next step, as the implementation was done to address the user's last message.
    -   **Next debug checklist:**
        - Await user feedback.
        - If issues are reported, ask for the complete error output from the PowerShell console and the application's developer tools.
        - Be prepared to debug Rust code, TypeScript code, or the interaction between them based on the user's report.
    -   **Why fix this issue and what will be achieved with the fix?** To validate the current progress and unblock further development.
    -   **Status:** USER VERIFICATION PENDING
    -   **Is recurring issue?** N
    -   **Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix?** Both (if issues are found).
-   **Issue 2: Fragile Local Build Environment (P1 - High Risk)**
    -   **Description:** The user has encountered numerous recurring problems building the project locally, stemming from missing dependencies (Rust, VS Build Tools, CMake), PowerShell policies, and npm <command>

npm@10.8.2 /usr/lib/node_modules/npm and  caches, and simplifying Rust dependencies by replacing them with PowerShell command wrappers.
    -   **Next debug checklist:**
        - If a build fails, immediately ask for the full error log.
        - Check against previous errors: missing ,  not found, PowerShell ,  errors, or Rust compiler errors.
        - Prefer simplifying dependencies over adding complex new ones. Using Rust to call a system command like  or a PowerShell script has proven to be a reliable fallback.
    -   **Why fix this issue and what will be achieved with the fix?** The project is completely blocked if the user cannot compile and run the code. Maintaining a stable build environment is paramount.
    -   **Status:** BLOCKED (This is a persistent risk, not an active bug)
    -   **Is recurring issue?** Y
    -   **Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix?** N/A (This is about enabling user testing).
    -   **Blocked on other issue:** None

**In progress Task List**:
None.

**Upcoming and Future Tasks**
-   **Upcoming Tasks:**
    -   **(P0) Implement Remaining Tool UIs:** Once the user approves the current tools, proceed with implementing the functional UIs for the remaining tools from the plan:
        -   ARP Viewer
        -   WHOIS
        -   SSL Checker
        -   Bandwidth Test
        -   MAC Formatter
        -   API Tester
        -   PAN-OS Generator
    -   **(P1) Create a Production Build:** Guide the user on how to run  to create a standalone  and  installer, and debug any issues that arise.
    -   **(P2) Add a Custom App Icon:** The current icon is a placeholder. A proper icon should be created and integrated.
-   **Future Tasks:**
    -   Implement Comparison & History features.
    -   Add Export functionality (CSV/PDF).
    -   Re-implement the Remote Tools feature (PSExec/SSH) in Rust, being mindful of the authentication challenges faced in the original Python app.

**Completed work in this session**
-   **Project Pivot and Scaffolding:** Successfully transitioned the project from Python/customtkinter to a new **Rust/Tauri/React** stack.
-   **UI Implementation:** Built a complete UI shell with a design system, layout, and base components based on user guidelines.
-   **Initial Tool Implementation:** Delivered seven functional tools with UIs connected to the Rust backend.
-   **Extensive Environment Debugging:** Successfully guided the user through setting up a complex local development environment and resolved over a dozen distinct build and compilation errors, unblocking the project multiple times.
-   **Tauri V2 Migration:** Corrected the initial project setup from Tauri v1 to v2, rewriting configuration files (, ) and adapting the code structure.

**Earlier issues found/mentioned but not fixed**
None. All identified issues were either resolved or are part of the upcoming task list.

**Known issue recurrence from previous fork**
- The Remote Tools feature was highly problematic in the original Python application due to cross-domain authentication issues. This feature is in the backlog for the new app and will require careful planning to avoid repeating those failures in Rust.

**Code Architecture**


**Key Technical Concepts**
-   **Framework:** Tauri v2
-   **Frontend:** React, TypeScript, Vite, TailwindCSS
-   **Backend:** Rust
-   **State Management:** Zustand
-   **Communication:** The   function is used for TypeScript-to-Rust communication.
-   **Dependency Workaround:** To ensure the user could build the project, complex Rust crates (like , ) were replaced with wrappers around standard Windows command-line tools (, ).

**key DB schema**
N/A (Local application without a database)

**changes in tech stack**
-   Complete migration from a **Python + customtkinter** stack to **Rust + Tauri + React**.

**All files of reference**
-   Project Root: 
-   Key Configs: , , 
-   Key Code: , all files in , all files in .

**Areas that need refactoring**:
-   The  and  modules use PowerShell and  respectively. This was a pragmatic choice to unblock the user's build process. If the user's environment stabilizes, these could be refactored to use more robust and cross-platform native Rust crates.

**key api endpoints**

**Critical Info for New Agent**
-   **Sprich Deutsch!** All user communication must be in German.
-   **The User is the Compiler:** You cannot build or test the Rust application. Your primary role is to write code and provide extremely clear, step-by-step instructions for the user to compile and test. Expect and be prepared for build errors from the user's machine.
-   **Prioritize Build Stability:** When adding features, prefer solutions that don't introduce complex dependencies. Using Rust to execute system commands has been a successful strategy to avoid dependency hell for the user.
-   **Follow the Debugging Pattern:** The session history contains a repeatable pattern for solving build issues: 1) Get the full error log from the user, 2) Identify the root cause (missing tool, bad config, code error), 3) Provide a precise fix (a command to run, a file to replace).

**Last 10 User Messages and any pending HUMAN messages**
1.  **User:** Reports  error during Rust compilation. **Status: COMPLETED** (Agent identified missing Visual Studio Build Tools and provided instructions).
2.  **User:** Reports a build error: . **Status: COMPLETED** (Agent fixed the  file for Tauri v2).
3.  **User:** Reports a build error: . **Status: COMPLETED** (Agent provided instructions to download a placeholder icon).
4.  **User:** Reports multiple Rust compiler errors. **Status: COMPLETED** (Agent fixed the code in several Rust command files).
5.  **User:** Reports Rust compiler error for . **Status: COMPLETED** (Agent refactored the SSL code to use PowerShell, removing the dependency).
6.  **User:** Reports multiple Rust compiler errors for . **Status: COMPLETED** (Agent refactored the DNS code to use , removing the dependency).
7.  **User:** the compiling went through but when I open the exe the page is not available. **Status: COMPLETED** (Agent explained the need to use  which runs the frontend server).
8.  **User:** yes with that the ui opens... **Status: ACKNOWLEDGED**.
9.  **User:** currently in the individual apps it says will be in a future version... so I cannot test the real tools. **Status: PENDING/IN PROGRESS**. This is the core request the agent just addressed.
10. **Agent:** (After implementing 7 tools) Finished! The following tools are now functional... Please update these files... then restart... Please test the tools.... **Status:** The agent has completed the implementation and is waiting for the user to see the message and test the results.

**Project Health Check:**
-   **Broken:** The local build process on the user's machine is extremely fragile and has been the source of most problems. While functional now, it is a significant risk.
-   **Mocked:** Several tool pages are still placeholders (ARP, WHOIS, SSL Checker, etc.) and are marked as future work.

**3rd Party Integrations**
